# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 21 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enrolled in Andrew Ng's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) course on Coursera, watched the first two introductory videos, and answered my first grading question. Also, watched five videos on vectors at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org).

**Thoughts:** Everything I learned about vectors in school came flooding back (which is a credit to my maths teachers, as that was almost 20 years ago). There were some interesting things I didn't know before as well, like how to write the definition of a line in n dimensions. The machine learning introduction was mostly stuff that I knew before, although I expect that will quickly change. Andrew Ng's example of a neural network was very clear, and the easiest to understand I've seen yet.
