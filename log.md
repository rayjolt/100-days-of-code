# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enrolled in Andrew Ng's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) course on Coursera, watched the first two introductory videos, and answered my first grading question. Also, watched five videos on vectors at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org).

**Thoughts:** Everything I learned about vectors in school came flooding back (which is a credit to my maths teachers, as that was almost 20 years ago). There were some interesting things I didn't know before as well, like how to write the definition of a line in n dimensions. The machine learning introduction was mostly stuff that I knew before, although I expect that will quickly change. Andrew Ng's example of a neural network was very clear, and the easiest to understand I've seen yet.

### Day 2: 22 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've finished week one of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course, including taking the quiz. That was a quick week! I got 10/10 on the quiz, yay. :) And I did some more brushing up on vectors on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts:** I still need more work on my vectors and matrices, so I think I will be doing them in parallel to the neural nets course. Week two of the course is going to involve a lot more of them, I'm guessing, so I'll have to judge my pace so that I learn enough linear algebra that I can progress, but not so much that I spend all of my time doing that.

### Day 3: 23 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent all of my time today learning about matrices on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts:** It turns out that after 18 years you forget how to do matrix multiplication. I still have a way to go to get back up to speed, but hopefully I can mostly do that tomorrow.

### Day 4: 24 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Also spent all of my time today learning about matrices on Khan Academy. This is becoming a theme. I covered 2D matrix transformations, and matrix inverses and determinants.

**Thoughts:** I was blown away by learning about matrix transformations, and realising that they basically underpin all of 3D computer graphics. When I get as far as matrix transposes I should be able to understand what's going on in the week 2 machine learning videos, so I'll switch back to Andrew Ng's course at that point.

### Day 5: 25 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying matrices and vectors at Khan Academy (for now), and am starting back on the machine learning course videos.

**Thoughts:** I now know a lot more about matrices than I did a few days ago, and the logistic regression algorithm in Andrew Ng's course is starting to make sense. I feel I'm making good progress.

### Day 6: 26 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched all of the compulsory week 2 videos for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course.

**Thoughts:** Today's videos were mostly about Python, which I'm a lot more at home with than the maths. Numpy is still new for me though, so it's still not exactly plain sailing. Tomorrow I'll be going on to the programming assignment. Finally, I'll be writing real code!

### Day 7: 27 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the introduction to numpy in the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course (hereby abbreviated to NNDL).

**Thoughts:** There were a few new concepts in the introduction - notably vector and matrix norms - so it was slow going. It was also my first time working with Jupyter notebooks, which are awesome so far (and I hear they get better). I can tell that it's going to take some time before I'm comfortable with all the maths here, but hey, that's the point, right? :)

### Day 8: 28 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did the week two quiz in the NNDL course, and worked on the numpy introduction some more.

**Thoughts:** I only got 9/10 on the quiz due to a careless mistake (boo). Otherwise, it wasn't too bad. The maths is still the bottleneck for me, but it's coming.

### Day 9: 29 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the numpy introduction, and started on the first required programming assignment.

**Thoughts:** The result of the programming assignment will be a real machine learning algorithm, so I'm pretty excited. :) Still, it's slow going, as I'm still getting used to numpy and matrices.

### Day 10: 30 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Just studied more about vectors today.

**Thoughts:** No earth-shattering discoveries today, but I did get to learn some interesting properties of vector dot products.

### Day 11: 31 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued the week two programming assignment.

**Thoughts:** My first successful forward propagation and back-propagation. Nice! Those cat pics aren't quite classified yet, though.

### Day 12: 1 April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the week two programming assignment. I now have a bona fide cat recognition algorithm. At the moment it has 70% accuracy.

**Thoughts:** Finishing week two feels good! I didn't find the programming hard - it was just learning the new ML concepts and getting used to NumPy, really. I actually found the "Introduction to NumPy" programming assignment trickier than the graded assignment.

### Day 13: 2 April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on the week 3 videos, and also started brushing up on my calculus at Khan Academy. (Today I went over the delta/epsilon limit proof, which I vaguely remember from school, but not well enough to feel comfortable going further in calculus without.) 

**Thoughts:** Again, I'm going to have to pace myself with calculus - I don't want to study it to the exclusion of the ML course and then have to do my assignments in a rush. But I have a strong feeling that a good understanding of it will help me. And hopefully the calculus from school will start coming back once I get back into it a bit.

### Day 14: 3 April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos about differential calculus on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts:** Just going over the basics again. In my school maths class we never learned limits formally, only informally, but I think that differential calculus is much easier to understand when you understand the formal definition of limits first.

### Day 15: 4 April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched more videos about differential calculus on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts:** Mmm, nutritious maths. Today I got past the formal introduction to the derivative of a function, and got on to the power rule. This is much more familiar to me - I remember doing a lot of this stuff in school. I think I'll go as far as the chain rule and then go back to the machine learning course.

### Day 16: 5 April 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied the chain rule, the product rule, and the quotient rule on Khan Academy, then tried to find the derivative of the sigmoid function.

**Thoughts:** I bought off a bit more than I could chew with the sigmoid function! I failed when I tried by myself, but I now know/remember enough calculus to understand the [derivation on Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/78575/derivative-of-sigmoid-function-sigma-x-frac11e-x).
