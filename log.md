# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Enrolled in Andrew Ng's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) course on Coursera, watched the first two introductory videos, and answered my first grading question. Also, watched five videos on vectors at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org).

**Thoughts:** Everything I learned about vectors in school came flooding back (which is a credit to my maths teachers, as that was almost 20 years ago). There were some interesting things I didn't know before as well, like how to write the definition of a line in n dimensions. The machine learning introduction was mostly stuff that I knew before, although I expect that will quickly change. Andrew Ng's example of a neural network was very clear, and the easiest to understand I've seen yet.

### Day 2: 22 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've finished week one of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course, including taking the quiz. That was a quick week! I got 10/10 on the quiz, yay. :) And I did some more brushing up on vectors on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts:** I still need more work on my vectors and matrices, so I think I will be doing them in parallel to the neural nets course. Week two of the course is going to involve a lot more of them, I'm guessing, so I'll have to judge my pace so that I learn enough linear algebra that I can progress, but not so much that I spend all of my time doing that.

### Day 3: 23 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent all of my time today learning about matrices on Khan Academy.

**Thoughts:** It turns out that after 18 years you forget how to do matrix multiplication. I still have a way to go to get back up to speed, but hopefully I can mostly do that tomorrow.

### Day 4: 24 March 2018

**Today's Progress**: Also spent all of my time today learning about matrices on Khan Academy. This is becoming a theme. I covered 2D matrix transformations, and matrix inverses and determinants.

**Thoughts:** I was blown away by learning about matrix transformations, and realising that they basically underpin all of 3D computer graphics. When I get as far as matrix transposes I should be able to understand what's going on in the week 2 machine learning videos, so I'll switch back to Andrew Ng's course at that point.
